Medica2 – Medicinal Plant Identification & Classification App

Medica2 is an intelligent Flutter application designed to identify and classify medicinal plants from images. Leveraging a custom-trained deep learning model, the app provides users with accurate predictions and detailed information about medicinal plants, including their scientific names, common names, and uses.

🌿 Project Overview

Medica2 aims to simplify access to medicinal plant knowledge by combining AI-powered classification with a rich plant encyclopedia. The application empowers users to:

Identify plant species instantly from images.

Explore medicinal properties and uses.

Contribute new plant images to enhance the AI model.

Ensure data reliability through expert verification.

👨‍💻 Developer

Awais Khan – Final Year Project (FYP) developer.
This project reflects 8–9 months of continuous research, development, and refinement in AI, Flutter, and mobile application development.

🔑 Key Features

AI Classification: Predicts plant species with high accuracy using a custom-trained deep learning model.

Community Contribution: Users can upload plant images to improve the model over time.

Expert Verification: Contributed images and data are validated by experts.

Plant Encyclopedia: Detailed information on medicinal plants and their properties.
